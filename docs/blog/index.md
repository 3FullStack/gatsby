We recently held a [webinar](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/behind-the-scenes/ "Behind the Scenes Webinar") on what makes Gatsby so fast, with performance optimization out of the box. During the live event, we got a lot of questions that we want to share with you here. Thereâ€™s a mix of topics from how we do image optimization, route-based code splitting, prefetching of routes with intersection observers, and more. Read on to get the answers to all the webinar questions as well as links to learn more.
